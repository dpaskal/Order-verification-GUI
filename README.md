# newpython

This python script produces a spreadsheet-like table. Its main purpose is to sort and filter the pending list.  
No longer needing to print hundreds of pages of paper is a plus.


# Key features:  
Filter orders by text.  
Sort orders by date.


It is organized as follows.  
Columns: [Accession, Name, DOC, Worklist, Pending Tests]  
Rows are the individual accessions.  

# Requirements

A text file placed in "My Documents" with the name "REFERENCE PENDING LIST (month)-(day).txt"  
Where month and day are the digits of the month and day. No leading zeros.  
For example the pending list for July 26th would be "REFERENCE PENDING LIST 7-26.txt"


An accompanying SmarTerm macro is used to create this list.
